## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need the following tools installed on your computer:

- Make
- Node 22 LTS
- Docker (required by Supabase)

Fork the [`marmelab/atomic-crm`](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm) repository to your user/organization, then clone it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[username]/atomic-crm.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
cd atomic-crm
make install
```

This will install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend, including a local Supabase instance.

Once your app is configured, start the app locally with the following command:

```sh
make start
```

This will start the Vite dev server for the frontend, the local Supabase instance for the API, and a Postgres database (thanks to Docker).

You can then access the app via [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). You will be prompted to create the first user.

If you need debug the backend, you can access the following services: 

- Supabase dashboard: [http://localhost:54323/](http://localhost:54323/)
- REST API: [http://127.0.0.1:54321](http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- Attachments storage: [http://localhost:54323/project/default/storage/buckets/attachments](http://localhost:54323/project/default/storage/buckets/attachments)
- Inbucket email testing service: [http://localhost:54324/](http://localhost:54324/)

## Hybrid Architecture: Supabase + Node.js + Spring Boot

This CRM follows a **hybrid architecture** approach:

- **Supabase + Node.js**: Powers existing CRM features (contacts, companies, deals, tasks, notes)
- **Spring Boot**: Custom microservice for business-specific requirements and extensions
- **Shared PostgreSQL Database**: Both services connect to the same Supabase PostgreSQL instance

### Setting Up the Hybrid Architecture

#### 1. Start the Core CRM (Supabase + Node.js)

The core CRM is already set up above with `make start`. This handles:
- Contact management
- Company management
- Deal pipeline
- Task tracking
- Note management
- Email capture

#### 2. Add Custom Features with Spring Boot

For custom business requirements (e.g., custom fields, workflows, integrations):

```bash
# Navigate to Spring Boot service
cd crm-custom-service-spring

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# The .env.example has default local settings configured
# For production, update .env with your actual Supabase credentials

# Install dependencies
mvn clean install

# Start the custom service (runs on port 8080)
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The Spring Boot service connects to the same PostgreSQL database as Supabase, allowing seamless data integration.

**Local Service URLs:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173/
- Supabase API: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- Spring Boot API: http://localhost:8080
- Supabase Dashboard: http://localhost:54323/
